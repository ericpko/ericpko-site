Hi, I'm Eric â€” a Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto interested in web development and computer graphics.

I enjoy building with Rust and Zig, and I'm currently working on Clubhouse, my latest project. This site is where I share what I'm learning and building.

I'm open to opportunities and collaborations. Check out my [projects](/projects) or browse my posts below.

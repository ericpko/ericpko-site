## Features

- **Interactive Grid** - Draw by moving your cursor across the grid
- **Dynamic Canvas** - Each cell responds to mouse interactions
- **DOM Manipulation** - Demonstrates event handling and element styling
- **Responsive Design** - Works across different screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Structure and layout
- **CSS** - Styling and visual design
- **TypeScript** - Logic and DOM manipulation
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, pure web fundamentals

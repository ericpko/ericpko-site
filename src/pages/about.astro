  <p>
    Hi, I'm Eric â€” a Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto with a passion for
    web development and computer graphics. I love building software that solves real problems and
    learning new technologies along the way.
  </p>

  <h2>What I'm Building</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently working on <a href="https://clubhaus.club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clubhouse</a>,
    a full-stack web application for managing tennis and pickleball clubs. The project is teaching me
    the complete web development experience: a Rust backend (Axum + PostgreSQL with sqlx), React frontend,
    Clerk authentication, and self-hosting on my VPS using Dokploy. I chose Rust for its type safety,
    performance, and language design, and I'm enjoying the challenge of mastering React and SQL.
  </p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    During my time at UofT, I worked on a capstone game design project where my team built
    <a href="https://josh-teichro.itch.io/a-weathery-journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Weathery Journey</a>
    in Unity. I also have a strong interest in computer graphics, including raytracing and physics-based animations.
  </p>

  <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
  <p>
    I'm actively seeking opportunities as a junior full-stack developer where I can contribute to
    meaningful projects and continue growing my skills. I'm particularly drawn to roles that involve
    modern web technologies, systems programming, or graphics work.
  </p>

  <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not programming, I'm usually playing tennis or pickleball (which inspired Clubhouse!),
    following the markets and learning about options trading, or exploring personal finance strategies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm Eric â€“ a software engineer and developer who loves building elegant solutions to complex problems.
    My passion lies in creating software that is both functional and beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in software development and engineering, with a focus on building scalable and
    maintainable applications. I enjoy working across the full stack and am always exploring new
    technologies and methodologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying current with the latest developments in technology,
    contributing to open source projects, and writing about software development.
